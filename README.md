Catalyzing Policing Reform with Data for Seattle


Beats:
In Seattle, the city is structured into five geographic areas, each containing a precinct or police station: North, East, South, West, and Southwest. The precinct boundaries align with neighborhood lines and natural geographic features. Each precinct is subdivided into smaller areas called Sectors, totaling 17 across the city. These Sectors are further divided into even smaller sections known as Beatsâ€”each Sector has about three Beats. For instance, the Ocean Sector includes Beats O1, O2, and O3. Beats are specific areas within the city that individual patrol officers are assigned to oversee.
